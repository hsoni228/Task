Start the website by :- 'Main_Page.html'. I used Xampp server for website. It was at localhost so link that appears on click of "Share My Location" is of type localhost, so kindly change link address according to your localhost and set path. My database is with my project named himanshu and connection is established in two files "insert.php" and "retrieve.php" so kindly change username and password in it to establish database connection. Google Api, AngularJs, Bootstrap are included in project. It contains different views in files "login_view1", "login_view2", "View_1", "View_2", "View_3".
